# Welcome to My Data Analyst Portfolio!

## Introduction
#### Hi! I'm Julia. 
##### I hold academic degree in Economics and recently completed Master's degree in Data Analytics and Global Logistics. My professional journey has been diverse, beginning as a Market Research Analyst and progressing into a Product Management role. Throughout my journey, I’ve developed a strong focus on data analytics, client consultation, and product development, which has given me a unique perspective on how data can drive business decisions.
##### In this portfolio, you'll find a collection of projects that showcase my expertise in data analysis, particularly in data visualisation and using tools like Python, R, Excel, and SQL. Whether it's through creating dashboards, performing statistical analysis, or building data models, I approach every project with a focus on delivering clear, insightful, and actionable results.

## Projects
### Python
#### Sales House Prediction
- Summary: Predicting residential properties sale prices in Ames, Iowa, based on various characteristics like house size and garage area. Data from the Ames Assessor's Office includes 82 columns and 2930 records of sold properties from 2006-2010. Using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression and evaluate model performance based on the adjusted R² value, ensuring the best model was selected by adjusting for the number of parameters to avoid adding insignificant variables. Future models should account for non-linear relationships and potential multicollinearity to better predict sale prices.

#### Inventory Management Dashboard
- Summary: This project is a part of University project to design and develop a real-time inventory management dashboard aimed at improving business operations by enhancing supply chain visibility. The problem addressed in this project revolves around the challenges businesses face in efficiently managing inventory levels, fulfilling customer orders, and minimising stockouts or excess inventory. Fluctuations in product demand and inefficient stock management can lead to customer dissatisfaction, missed sales opportunities, and unnecessary costs.
